# Jacob Dunefsky's personal website
My personal page, at [jacobdunefsky.github.io](jacobdunefsky.github.io), is written in [bastet](https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/bastet), a simple static templating language I created. This repository contains the bastet code that is turned into the HTML available at [the repository for jacobdunefsky.github.io](https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/jacobdunefsky.github.io).
