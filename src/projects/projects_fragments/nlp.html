<p>For my final project in my NLP class, I investigated the way in which various NLP models, including two based on the widely-used Transformer architecture, embed Czech nouns depending on their grammatical case. In order to do this, the project made use of standard techniques in modern NLP, such as the analysis of word embeddings. Other components of the project included creating a dataset by scraping Wiktionary; introducing an intuitive geometrically-motivated numerical measure of similarity; finetuning a Transformer model; and generating graphs with Matplotlib.</p>
