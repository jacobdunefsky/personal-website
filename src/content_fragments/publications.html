	<h3>Analysis of neural clusters due to deep brain stimulation pulses</h3>
	<p>Kuelbs, D., <b>Dunefsky, J. (co-first-author)</b>, Monga, B. and Moehlis, J., 2020. Biological Cybernetics,

	<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established method for treating pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, Tourette syndrome, and essential tremor. While the precise mechanisms which underly the effectiveness of DBS are not fully understood, several theoretical studies of populations of neural oscillators stimulated by periodic pulses have suggested that this may be related to clustering, in which subpopulations of the neurons are synchronized, but the subpopulations are desynchronized with respect to each other. The details of the clustering behavior depend on the frequency and amplitude of the stimulation in a complicated way. In the present study, we investigate how the number of clusters and their stability properties, bifurcations, and basins of attraction can be understood in terms of one-dimensional maps defined on the circle. Moreover, we generalize this analysis to stimuli that consist of pulses with alternating properties, which provide additional degrees of freedom in the design of DBS stimuli. Our results illustrate how the complicated properties of clustering behavior for periodically forced neural oscillator populations can be understood in terms of a much simpler dynamical system.</p>

	<h4>Objective</h4>
	<p>The unique features of technological applications may improve the treatment of people at risk of suicide. In this article, we present feasibility and acceptability data as well as two case studies demonstrating the use of WellPATH, a tablet app that aims to help suicidal patients during emotionally-charged situations outside of therapy sessions. The WellPATH app was part of a 12-week psychotherapy intervention (CRISP – Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention) for middle-aged and older adults after their discharge from a suicide-related hospitalization.</p>

	<h4>Design</h4>
	<p>The use of WellPATH includes three stages: preparation and practice, incorporation, and actual use.</p>

	<h4>Measurements</h4>
	<p>Feasibility was measured by the overall use of WellPATH during 12 weeks, and acceptability was measured with the three items of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire.</p>

	<h4>Results</h4>

	<p>Twelve study participants were administered WellPATH as part of CRISP. The results provide preliminary evidence of feasibility and acceptability of WellPATH. Study participants and therapists reported high satisfaction with WellPATH and provided feedback for future research and development. The patients in the case studies reported a reduction in negative emotions and an increase in emotion regulation (i.e., cognitive reappraisal ability) after using techniques on the WellPATH app.</p>

	<h4>Conclusion</h4>

	<p>Our preliminary findings suggest that use of technology applications such as the WellPATH app is feasible and accepted among middle-aged and older adults at high suicide risk. Further research with an adequately powered sample is needed to further evaluate WellPATH's feasibility and accessibility, and test its efficacy with this high-risk population.</p>
