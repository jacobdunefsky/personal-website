	<h2>About me.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Jacob Dunefsky. Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student at Yale University advised by Arman Cohan, where I research mechanistic interpretability for large language models (i.e. I try to understand why AI does what it does, and how to make sure it doesn't do bad things.) Previously, I was a scholar in the <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS Program</a> under Neel Nanda's advisorship; our work focused on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11944">reverse-engineering LLM computations into interpretable feature circuits using a tool called transcoders.</a>Before that, I received a combined B.S./M.S. in computer science from Yale University in December 2023.</p>

		<li>...developing methods to make targeted changes to LLM behaviors that only need extremely small amounts of training data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18862">Our most recent work</a> (accepted to COLM 2025) shows that steering vectors trained on a single example can make generalized changes to safety-relevant behaviors in LLMs.</li>
