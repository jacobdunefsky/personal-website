	<h2>About me.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Jacob Dunefsky. Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an undergraduate at Yale University pursuing a combined B.S./M.S. degree in computer science. I've been programming in some capacity for over a decade now, and over the course of that time, I have really come to love it.</p>
	<p>Over the course of this journey, I've come into possession of a fair amount of technical skills, even though there is always more to learn. I've gotten my hands dirty with OS development, web dev, audio synthesis, machine learning, mobile app development, networks development, and quite a bit else.</p>
	<p>In addition to programming itself, I have done a hefty amount of proof-based math, including real analysis, linear algebra, and abstract algebra. I've found that this background often comes in necessary when keeping up with state-of-the-art work in many fields of computer science.</p>
	<p>Of course, I also have interests beyond these technical matters: I enjoy language-learning, writing music, and exercising. But for now, we'll put those subjects aside.</p>
