	<h2>About me.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Jacob Dunefsky. Welcome to my homepage! I am an undergraduate at Yale University pursuing a combined B.S./M.S. degree in computer science.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>...working on networking research related to optimizing large transfers for data-intensive sciences. If you would like to learn more, you can read our team's workshop paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3538401.3548550">"Transport control networking: optimizing efficiency and control of data transport for data-intensive networks"</a>.</li>
		<li>...working as a ULA (undergraduate learning assistant) for Yale's course "CPSC 422/522: Design and Implementation of Operating Systems". In this course, students learn about operating system development by implementing key features themselves; my responsibilities are to help them succeed in the course by holding office hours and answering questions.</li>

	<h2>I am currently...</h2>
	<hr/>
	<ul>
		<li>...working on research regarding mechanistic interpretability for large language models. This research involves a method to find feature vectors in Transformer models without using inexpensive probing or autoencoder methods, and can be used to diagnose the causes of gender bias in language models. A preprint is forthcoming.</li>
		<li>...working as a ULA (undergraduate learning assistant) for Yale's course "CPSC 488/588: AI Foundational Model". In this course, students learn about state-of-the-art AI foundation models such as Transformers for NLP and diffusion models for image generation, by engaging with cutting-edge research and implementing this research themselves. My responsibilities include writing problem sets, grading problem sets and exams, and holding office hours.</li>
