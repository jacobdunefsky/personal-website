	<h2>About me.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Jacob Dunefsky. Welcome to my homepage! I am a researcher in mechanistic interpretability for large language models (i.e. I try to understand why AI does what it does, and how to make sure it doesn't do bad things.) Previously, I received a combined B.S./M.S. in computer science from Yale University in December 2023.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>...a scholar in the MATS program (ML Alignment and Theory Scholars), where I am doing research in mechanistic interpretability under Neel Nanda's advisorship. Our current work focuses on reverse-engineering SAE features in LLMs. Interested readers familiar with mechanistic interpretability can check out <a href="https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/gelu-1l-reversing">this repo</a>, which showcases some interim results.</li>
